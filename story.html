    <h1>The Sleet that Rained like Bouncing Goldfish</h1>
<h4>A Short Story
  by Jane Doe</h4>
Tristan Thornton was thinking about Phil Butterscotch again. Phil was a loving do gooder with scrawny eyelashes and vast spots.

Tristan walked over to the window and reflected on his picturesque surroundings. He had always loved backward Sidney with its low, loud lakes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel calm.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a loving figure of Phil Butterscotch.

Tristan gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an arrogant, cold-blooded, squash drinker with brown eyelashes and wobbly spots. His friends saw him as a dull, defiant dolphin. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved a yarbing old lady.

But not even an arrogant person who had once jumped into a river and saved a yarbing old lady, was prepared for what Phil had in store today.

The sleet rained like bouncing goldfish, making Tristan stressed. Tristan grabbed a stripy rock that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Tristan stepped outside and Phil came closer, he could see the short smile on his face.

"I am here because I want a pencil," Phil bellowed, in a predatory tone. He slammed his fist against Tristan's chest, with the force of 2022 elephants. "I frigging love you, Tristan Thornton."

Tristan looked back, even more stressed and still fingering the stripy rock. "Phil, I shrunk the kids," he replied.

They looked at each other with delighted feelings, like two faithful, fluttering flamingos dancing at a very stupid wedding, which had piano music playing in the background and two proud uncles laughing to the beat.

Suddenly, Phil lunged forward and tried to punch Tristan in the face. Quickly, Tristan grabbed the stripy rock and brought it down on Phil's skull.

Phil's scrawny eyelashes trembled and his vast spots wobbled. He looked sneezy, his body raw like a troubled, tasteless teapot.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Phil Butterscotch was dead.

Tristan Thornton went back inside and made himself a nice beaker of squash.
